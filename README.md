This repository contains all the code used in the MBiol dissertation title "Trends in Extreme Climate Events in the Arctic and Their Ecological Consequences".

List of the supplementary materials provided:

**Meta-Analysis**

*R code files:*
- calculate_effect_size.R - an R file containing the code used to convert effect sizes to SMDH and build all meta-analytical models
- meta_baselines_16_day.R - an R file used to calculate the 90th percentile for 'days' used to identify extreme years in study 16

*Raw data files:*
